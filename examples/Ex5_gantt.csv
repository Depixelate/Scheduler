MathAssn: 1. The dimensional cube  defined as that graph whose vertex set is the set of ordered tuples of  (Commonly called  bit strings) and where two vertices are adjacent if their ordered tuples differ in exactly one position (co-ordinate).  The dimensional cubes for  are shown in Figure.,2023-11-12,2023-11-15
